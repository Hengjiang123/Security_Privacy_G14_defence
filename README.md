This project can run a simulating digital bank website (Flask + SQLAlchemy + SQLite structure) with some basic functions, and also contain some attack tools in the folder "attacks".

To run the digital bank web, you just need to prepare the environments which mentioned in the folder "env", and run the file app.py directly.

Attention: The attacks especially the Dos need to be run in a separate PC, cause it might occupy the CPU or flow of the Cloud server completely.
